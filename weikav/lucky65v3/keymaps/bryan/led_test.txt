LED MAPPING TEST INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

This test firmware will cycle through each LED index and light it up one at a time.
You'll need to record which physical key lights up for each LED index.

HOW TO USE:
1. Flash the test firmware
2. Wait for LED cycling to start (it begins automatically)
3. For each lit LED, record which physical key is lit
4. The cycle repeats every ~70 seconds

TIMING:
- Each LED stays lit for 1 second
- LED indices tested: 0-69

RECORDING FORMAT:
LED_INDEX -> PHYSICAL_KEY_NAME

Example:
0 -> ESC
1 -> 1

...etc
